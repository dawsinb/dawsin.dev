    When I was in university I originally planned on going into the field of <em>machine learning</em>
    . My focus has since shifted towards design, but I am still very interested in the usage of machine learning,
    particularly for artistic pursuits.

    Here are the links to the two papers I worked on if you are interested:
    <br />
    <br />- <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12463">Slimming Neural Networks using Adaptive Connectivity Scores</a>
    <br />
    <br />-{' '}
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12617">
      Adaptive County Level COVID-19 Forecast Models: Analysis and Improvement
    </a>
