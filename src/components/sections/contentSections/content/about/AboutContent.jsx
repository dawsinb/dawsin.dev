    Hello, as you may have guessed from the name of the site, my name is <em>Dawsin</em>. I’m a programmer and artist
    with a passion for the combination of these two fields.
    <br />
    <br />
    My work has primarily been in <em>web development</em>, making both traditional sites and gpu accelerated 3D sites
    like this one. As well as some video game programming.
    <br />
    <br />
    But that’s not to say I’m only interested in these areas, I’m always looking to push the envelope in new ways.
  </div>
