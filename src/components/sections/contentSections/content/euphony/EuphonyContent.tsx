    Combining programming, design, and music, one of my interests is the creation of audio visualizers. As such I
    decided to develop a library called <em>euphony</em> to help me and anyone else create visualizers on the web.
    <br />
    <br />
    Euphony is a library which allows for easy playback and analysis of audio files. You can use it with any animation
    library or even plain Javascript. Itâ€™s open source and written entirely in Typescript. And it is also lightweight
    with zero dependencies.
